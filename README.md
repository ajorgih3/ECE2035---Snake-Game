# Snake Game
Please watch this youtube video that I made for the final ECE 2035 project Fall 2020!
This will give a brief overview of what the game really is. 
Copy of the code will be provided to employers or ECE 2035 alumni as the project idea will be use every semester according to Dr. Linda Wills.
Enjoy!
